<h4>October 10th</h4>
<ul>
<li><h5>Reading Discussion</h5>
<p>In Groups of 2-3, discuss your reactions to the two papers, Design as Exploration and Design Galleries. Focus on the following prompts in your discussion.</p>
<p>How do these two papers frame the role of the designer when using parametric systems? What are the trade-offs of these different framings?</p>
<p>How do the methods presented by the Design Galleries and Juxtapose systems align with your approach to design? Are they compatible? Not compatible?</p></li>
<p>Both papers focus on the process of tuning in parametric design, however Juxtapose positions tuning as a feature, where as Design Galleries positions tuning as a tedious process to be eliminated. Which of these perspectives resonates with you?</p>
<p>Design Galleries was written over 20 years ago, and part of the contribution of the work relates to creating variations in graphics with computers that were much less powerful than they are today. Are the contributions of Design Galleries less relevant now that computers are faster?</p>
<p></p></li>

<p>Follow with a joint group review.</p>

<h5>Code Assignment: Create a Parametric 3D Form.</h5>
  <p>Using the 3D mode in Processing, create a parameterized 3D form</p>
  <p>The form can be a variation of the vase shape demonstrated in class, or a new 3D design that you create using the Processing 3D primitives and shapes. You can create a form that is abstract (i.e. an amorphous shape) or representational (i.e. a chair). Your program must include the following:</p>
  <p>An explicit set of constraints- i.e. the constants in your design</p>
  <p>At least one degree of freedom- i.e. the variables in your design</p>
  <p>A simple interface that exposes these variables for exploration or tuning. This can include a set of sliders for continious values, a gallery that generates a range, or something that combines these approaches.</p>
  <p>Chose three "succesful" outcomes from your parametric system and save screenshots of them.</p>
  <p>After creating your design, write a 1 paragraph description of how you chose the constraints and degrees of freedom in your design.</p>
<p>Upload your Processing code, screenshots to your github repository in the projects/week3 directory. Also upload a text or markdown document with your 1 paragraph description. Please upload this material by 6:00 PM Monday evening. We will try out your parametric sytems in class on Tuesday October 15th.</p>
