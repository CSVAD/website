<h4>October 1st</h4>
<ul>
<li><h5>Check in</h5>
<p>Technical challenges/ questions from previous week. Check in on reading / assigment time.</p></li>
<li><h5>Review Code of Conduct</h5></li>
<li><h5>Short Reading Discussion</h5>
<p>General thoughts and reflections from previous week's readings.</p>
<p>What ideas of McCullough's and Reichart's aligned with the preconceptions people had about the creative applications of compulation? What ideas were suprising?</p>
<p>What do you think (if anything) has changed since these works were written?</p>
<p>How did the process of working with Processing and working by hand align with the ideas presented by McCullough and Reichardt?</p></li>
<li><h5>Introduction to Computational Repetition</h5></li>
<p><a href="https://www.atariarchives.org/artist/sec5.php">Computer Grass is Natural Grass</a></p>
<p>Computers are, at a very basic level, mechanisms for repetition. They can perform a task multiple times, in the exact same form (nearly), each time. Repetition is intrinsic to computing, but also plays a key role in visual art and design. Artists and designers rely on the repetition of forms, colors, spatial relationships and other forms to introduce rhythm and structure into a piece. </p>
<h6>Symmetry</h6>
   <p>Symmetry is one intial form of repetition, that is often found in nature, and reproduced in many forms of design and ornament.</p>
   <h6>Examples: </h6>
    <ul>
   <li><a href="https://mymodernmet.com/ernst-haeckel-art/">Ernst Haekel:</a> German Biologist who illustrated microscoping structures of radiolarians</li>
   <li><a href="http://bantjes.com/work/armorial-holiday-card-2/">Marjane Bantjes:</a>designer, typographer, writer and illustrator who works with both digital and traditional drawing tools</a> </li>
   <li><a href="https://joshuadavis.com/Moth-Bodies">Joshua Davis:</a> Computational artist and graphic designer. Josh's work combines complex illustrated elements with computational symmetry and repetition.</li>
 </ul>
<h6>Grid</h6>  
<p>"A grid system is not just a set of rules to follow... but it's also a set of rules to play off of–to break, even. Given the right grid – the right system of constraints – very good designers can create solutions that are both orderly and unexpected.</br>

Khoi Vinh, New York Times- referenced from <a href="https://runemadsen.com/syllabi/programming-design-systems/">Rune Madsen's Programming Design Systems"</a>.</p>
<p>Grids- repeating structures of form and spacing provide a means to organize a design and partition space. Grids can establish rythym and create a sense of flow, however they can also be shifted, manipulated, and broken to create interest, focus, and suprise. </p>

<h6>Examples: </h6>
    <ul>
<li><a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/bridget-riley-1845">Bridget Riley:</a>  English Painter who is one of the most prominent creators of OpArt. Riley's paintings use repetition and contrast to create subtle effects on the eyes of the viewer [<a href="http://formandcode.com/contents">Reas et. al.</a>]</li>
 <li><a href="http://www.artnet.com/artists/vera-molnar/?type=works-on-paper">Vera Molnar:</a>Hungarian artist who created intricate plotter-based artwork. One of the first artists to use a plotter.</li>
