    <h1 class="cover-heading">Computational Systems for Visual Art and Design</h1>
    <p >Computational systems of rules, relationships, and behaviors can extend traditional art and design practices or support new creative workflows and outcomes.  In this course, we will explore the creation of computational systems for visual art and design. Following a studio format, we will learn creative coding platforms and algorithms to create visual works that are flexible, dynamic, and generative. In the process, we will touch on the design philosophy and abstractions of existing creative coding platforms and examine methods to create alternatives. Students will learn basic approaches to modify creative programming languages and frameworks or develop new software interfaces for visual expression. Technical production will be complemented by readings on computational art and design theory and review of seminal works in computational art and design.</p>

   <!-- <h3 class="cover-heading">Introduction</h3>
    <p><i>Art, in the only sense in which one can separate art from technics, is primarily the domain of the person; and the purpose of art, apart from various incidental technical functions that may be associated with it, is to widen the province of personality, so that feelings, emotions, attitudes, and values, in the special individualized form in which they happen in one particular person, in one particular culture, can be transmitted with all their force and meaning to other persons or to other cultures.</i>
    </br> -Lewis Mumford, Art and Technics, 1952 </p>
    <p>Whether as a tool or as a material, technology has almost always been present in human art and design. Computation in particular that has had a widespread impact on art and design. From their first application as tools for expression, computers significantly changed how we make art. Unlike previous technological tools, computers enabled the creation of works were not manually executed by human hands, nor explicitly conceived of by human minds. </p>

<p>Computers enable works of art and design to be expressed through code:  a series of computational rules or relationships (or procedures) that can be compiled and executed by a computer.  Coding allows artists to manage complex structures, automate processes, and generalize and reuse operations.  When applied to visual expression, code enables the creation of visual media that is dynamic, responsive, interactive, and generative. Code also supports specific ways of thinking about the art and design process. Rather than produce discrete artifacts, creators can conceive of works as systems that contain numerous, or even infinite variations of an idea.</p>

<p>In addition to new opportunities, creating works of art and design with code poses new challenges. Artists and designers must frequently repurpose programming languages that were developed for other applications. Programming in general requires understanding abstract representations and working in a highly structured manner, which can conflict with the exploratory nature of many forms of art and design. Visual artists and designers are also drawn to visual tools and media but programming requires manipulating a representational description of the work. he culture surrounding computer programming can also impose limits and restrictions on who can participate, and which works are validated and which are not. </p>

<p>In this course, we will explore the opportunities and challenges of using code to create visual art and design. We will produce works of art and design with existing programming languages, and we will  engage in the creation of new coding tools, interfaces, and abstractions. In the process, we will examine the history and theory of applying code to the production of aesthetic visual works.</p>-->
